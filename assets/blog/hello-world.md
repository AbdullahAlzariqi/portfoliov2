Welcome to the blog. This is a sample post written in Markdown. Drop your own `.md` files into `assets/blog/` and rebuild the index to see them listed.

## Why this setup?

- Minimal static hosting friendly
- Plain Markdown authoring
- Automatic index generation with a tiny script

  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

That’s all—happy writing!
